# React Three Fiber Boilerplate

A modern React-based 3D web development boilerplate using React Three Fiber. This template provides a clean starting point for creating interactive 3D web applications with React and Three.js.

## Features

- **React Three Fiber** setup with modern React practices
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **@react-three/drei** for ready-to-use Three.js helpers
- Responsive 3D canvas
- Modern project structure
- ESLint configuration for code quality
- Hot module replacement for fast development
- TypeScript support
- Production-ready build setup

## Setup
